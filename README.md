# What is FF4J ?

FF4J, stands for Feature Flipping - for Java, implements the [Feature Toggle](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/FeatureToggle.html) agile development practice.
It allows you to easily enable and disable features at runtime through dedicated console. Once enabled you can limit the usage to a limited subset of user through role administration. Once enabled and granted you can finally implement an overriding flipping strategy
