# What is FF4J ?

FF4J, stands as - Feature Flipping for Java -, implements the [Feature Toggle](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/FeatureToggle.html) 
agile development practice. It allows you to easily enable and disable features at runtime through dedicated console.
Even if a feature is enabled, you can limit its usage to a subset of users through roles.
You can finally defined your own strategy to decide if a feature is enabled based on custom context (e.g : the call me button should be available only during office hours 09:00-18:00 (full sample in documentation)
