# Contribute

## Introduction

First, thank you for considering contributing to ff4j! It's people like you that make the open source community such a great community! ðŸ˜Š

We welcome any type of contributions, not just code. You can help with:
- **QA**: Filing bug reports, the more details you can give the better (e.g. screenshots with the console open)
- **Marketing**: Writing blog posts, how-to's, printing stickers, etc.
- **Community**: Presenting the project at meetups, organizing a dedicated meetup group for the local community, etc.
- **Code**: Taking a look at the list of [open issues](issues). Even if you can't write code you can comment on them. Showing that you care about a given issue matters, and it helps us prioritize them.
- **Money**: We welcome financial contributions in full transparency on our [open collective](https://opencollective.com/ff4j) account.

## Your First Contribution

Working on your first Pull Request? You can learn how from this *free* series, [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://egghead.io/series/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github).

## Submitting code

Any code changes should be submitted as a Pull Request. The description should explain what the code does and give steps to execute it. The Pull Request should also contain tests and they should all pass.

## Code review process

Generally speaking, the bigger the Pull Request, the longer it will take to review and merge. So try to break down a large Pull Request into smaller chunks that are easier to review and merge.
It is always helpful to have some context for your Pull Request. What is the purpose? Why does it matter to you?

## Financial contributions

We also welcome financial contributions in full transparency on our [open collective](https://opencollective.com/ff4j) account.
Anyone can file an expense. If the expense makes sense for the development of the community, it will be "merged" in the ledger of our open collective by the core contributors and the person who filed the expense will be reimbursed.

## Questions or Problems

If you have any questions or problems, create an [issue](issue). (__Protip__: Before crreating an issue, do a quick search to see if someone aleady created an issue covering your question or problem!)
You can also reach us at hello@ff4j.opencollective.com.
